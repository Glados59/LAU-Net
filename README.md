# LAU-Net
This repo is the official pytorch implement for LAU-Net: Latitude Adaptive Upscaling Network for Omnidirectional Image Super-resolution (CVPR, 2021).
The code will be coming soon. 

We are making some important improvements on our work. The codes will be released along with the journal edition of our work. If you have any problem, please ask me through issues or my email wang_hao@buaa.edu.cn. I'll reply soon.
